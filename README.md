# _Marbling Space_

#### _A Marbling Space_

#### By _James Wyn_

## Proposal

Name of Student:  James Wyn

Name of Project: Marbling Playspace

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

Won't really "do" much for them.  It will be a playspace that allows the user to pool colors in certain locations, layer them as wanted, then draw through the space to make designs

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

    Color pooling
    Color displacement
    Weighted node based drawing

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

    JS library for node based physics - Sigma.js or Unity
    C# if unity - JS if Sigma

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

    Save space for export
    import designs
    multi user functionality

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

    Websockets - multiuser
    Local Storage
    More research for import

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

Not that I can think of?


## Description

This application will allow th euser to draw out pools of color and then control color flow through direct manipulation of the playspace physics
